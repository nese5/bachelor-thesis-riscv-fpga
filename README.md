## Topic
Connecting a Verilog IP block to a RISC-V Microcontroller.

## Tools & Technologies
- RISC-V
- FPGA (Alhambra II)
- Icestudio
- SystemVerilog
- C
- APIO toolchain

## What I did
- Designed a RISC-V based SoC architecture
- Integrated a custom IP block (PWM)
- Compiled and uploaded C programs to FPGA
- Verified functionality on physical hardware

## Results
- Successfully ran custom firmware on FPGA
- Verified correct operation of the integrated IP block
